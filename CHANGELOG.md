# Changelog

All notable changes to Codeg for iOS are recorded here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Add changes under `## [Unreleased]` as you land them. When you cut a release,
`scripts/release.sh` moves that section under a new version heading and reuses
the text as the git tag message and the GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Chats and Search can hide completed conversations, matching desktop. Off
  by default; a filter menu turns them back on. Pinned rows stay visible.

### Changed

- Apple signing now uses an ignored local configuration instead of a committed
  development team identifier.
### Fixed

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **New agent types** — CodeBuddy, Kimi Code, and Pi.
- One-command release automation: `scripts/release.sh` bumps the version, files
  the release notes, tags, pushes, and creates a GitHub Release (with an
  optional `--archive` App Store Connect upload leg).
- This `CHANGELOG.md` as the home for version notes.

### Changed

- The app version is now single-sourced from `MARKETING_VERSION` /
  `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml`.

### Fixed

- Streaming no longer rebuilds the entire transcript on every token, keeping
  long sessions smooth.
- The pending approval card is restored after a mid-turn stream reconnect.
- `Info.plist` no longer hardcodes `CFBundleShortVersionString`, which had
  silently overridden `MARKETING_VERSION` so version bumps didn't take effect.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Initial Codeg for iOS release.
